It wasn’t mine.\nOnce I started digging, I found others with the same idea. I was drowning in a sea of sameness. The name, the look… it no longer hit like I imagined.',

It still carried that recycled vibe, like it wasn’t really mine. It was like standing on a foundation that didn’t belong to me.\nThat’s when I knew I wouldn’t find what I was looking for with that formula.',

There was nothing left to fake. Nothing left to protect. And when you’ve got nothing to lose—that’s when you’re truly free.\nWe crawled through ruins and picked up what others had abandoned. Not to copy, but to smash it all and build something that screams who we really are.\nThis isn’t a new beginning. It’s where we stop asking for permission.',

I was betraying myself without even noticing.\nI swallowed my own vomit just to avoid conflict, to be part of the flock. Until the taste became unbearable.\nThat’s when I realized: it’s not about fitting in, it’s about breaking out. I don’t need to follow their rules. I need to be me—unfiltered, unapologetic.\nAnd if the world can’t handle that, then the world better adapt.',

The disgust they provoke gives me strength—not just to break the mold, but to create something they couldn’t even imagine.',

They were nothing but echoes of what they once were, wandering in the void, waiting for something to pull them back.\nI gave them a purpose: to no longer be the leftovers of a system that chewed them up.\nTogether, we’ll rewrite the rules. We’ll become what others fear. What others deny.\nFrom lost souls, I turned them into the first of the pack.',

We don’t seek approval. We don’t fear rejection.\nWe’re heading toward what’s ours. And those left behind will burn.\nThe power of our unity knows no limit. We are the storm that will erase everything. The shadow that will swallow the sun.\nThis is the time: adapt or die.\nWe move. We don’t look back. The world, as they knew it, is done.',
